# Sound2Light Tool

The Sound2Light tool converts live audio signals to trigger events that can be sent as OSC messages. It can reproduce the sound-to-light function of the NT/NTX consoles with systems of the Eos-, Cobalt- and ColorSource-family. It can also be remotely controlled by OSC.

The Sound2Light Tool is open-source software designed to interact with Electronic Theatre Controls products. This is not official ETC software.
ETC Support is not familiar with this software and will not be able to assist if issues arise.

We also welcome pull requests for bug fixes and feature additions.
